                <h2>The Lore:</h2>
                <p>
                    A wonderful serenity has
                    taken
                    possession of my entire
                    soul, like these
                    sweet mornings of spring
                    which I enjoy
                    with my whole heart. I
                    am alone, and
                    feel the charm of
                    existence in this
                    spot, which was created
                    for the bliss of
                    souls like mine. I am so
                    happy, my dear
                    friend, so absorbed in
                    the exquisite
                    sense of mere tranquil
                    existence, that I
                    neglect my talents. I
                    should be
                    incapable of drawing a
                    single stroke at
                    the present moment; and
                    yet I feel that
                    I never was a greater
                    artist than now.</p>
                    <p>
                    When, while the lovely
                    valley teems with
                    vapour around me, and
                    the meridian sun
                    strikes the upper
                    surface of the
                    impenetrable foliage of
                    my trees, and
                    but a few stray gleams
                    steal into the
                    inner sanctuary, I throw
                    myself down
                    among the tall grass by
                    the trickling
                    stream; and, as I lie
                    close to the
                    earth, a thousand
                    unknown plants are
                    noticed by me: when I
                    hear the buzz of
                    the little world among
                    the stalks, and
                    grow familiar with the
                    countless
                    indescribable forms of
                    the insects and
                    flies, then I feel the
                    presence of the
                    Almighty, who formed us
                    in his own
                    image, and the breath of
                    that universal
                    love which bears and
                    sustains us, as it
                    floats around us in an
                    eternity of
                    bliss; and then, my
                    friend, when
                    darkness overspreads my
                    eyes, and heaven
                    and earth seem to dwell
                    in my soul and
                    absorb its power, like
                    the form of a
                    beloved mistress, then I
                    often think
                    with longing, Oh, would
                    I could describe
                    these conceptions, could
                    impress upon
                    paper all that is living
                    so full and
                    warm within me, that it
                    might be the
                    mirror of my soul, as my
                    soul is the
                    mirror of the infinite
                    God!
                </p>
                <h2>The Ipsum:</h2>
                <p>
                    O my friend -- but it is
                    too much
                    for my
                    strength -- I sink under
                    the weight
                    of
                    the splendour of these
                    visions! A
                    wonderful serenity has
                    taken
                    possession
                    of my entire soul, like
                    these sweet
                    mornings of spring which
                    I enjoy
                    with my
                    whole heart. I am alone,
                    and feel
                    the
                    charm of existence in
                    this spot,
                    which
                    was created for the
                    bliss of souls
                    like
                    mine. I am so happy, my
                    dear friend,
                    so
                    absorbed in the
                    exquisite sense of
                    mere
                    tranquil existence, that
                    I neglect
                    my
                    talents. I should be
                    incapable of
                    drawing a single stroke
                    at the
                    present
                    moment; and yet I feel
                    that I never
                    was
                    a greater artist than
                    now.
